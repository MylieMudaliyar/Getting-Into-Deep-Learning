# Deep Learning and Neural Networks

#### We have seen how popular LLMs (infamous GPT) have got in recent years. Deep learning encompasses a broad range of techniques, including neural networks, which form the foundation for many state-of-the-art models like these. 
#### I recently realised how important is to understand the underlying concepts of neural networks. It is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of these technologies beyond merely utilizing pre-built libraries and frameworks.

Now, that I am starting from the basics, I thought of documenting my journey so that others can benefit too.

- ###  I've delved into various resources including YouTube videos, textbooks, and articles. 
- ###  Below, I've compiled a collection of links to these resources, each offering valuable insights into the underlying concepts of neural networks and deep learning.

- ###   You'll find code implementations in the repository, organized into respective folders.

## Books : 
1. [Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow](https://powerunit-ju.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Aurelien-Geron-Hands-On-Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-Learn-Keras-and-Tensorflow_-Concepts-Tools-and-Techniques-to-Build-Intelligent-Systems-OReilly-Media-2019.pdf) by Aurelien Geron. Perfect for beginners, the 2nd part is about Deep Learning.
2. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by Michael Neilson. It's available for free online and covers all the core concepts with codes as well.

## Web Links / Youtube :
